    <h1>The tranSMART Library</h1>
    <div id="welcome">
      <p> Welcome to the site of the tranSMART Foundation's Library. It
        contains two clusters of resources, Curated Datasets and
        Installation Files. <br>
      </p>
      <h2>Curated Datasets</h2>
      <p>A tutorial on loading diverse data types (the Cell Line Use
        Case data sets) into tranSMART can be found <a
href="https://wiki.transmartfoundation.org/display/transmartwiki/Tutorial%3A+How+to+load+the+Cell+Line+Use+Case+dataset+with+transmart-data">here</a>
        You can download data files from this site and then load these
        local files as documented on that page.<br>
        <br>
        You can also load files directly from this site by using the <a
href="https://github.com/tranSMART-Foundation/transmart-data/tree/release-1.2.5-Beta">transmart-data


          loading tools</a> (see the README.md file, which shows up as
        the documentation of the transmart-data link - especially the
        section "Running ETL targets").</p>
      <p><a href="datasets">The dataset folder directory</a> shows the
        available datasets. Individual parts of each dataset can be
        downloaded as a compressed data file, by drilling down into
        these directories.<br>
      </p>
      <h2>Release Artifacts <img id="sign"
          src="images/Under_Construction_Sign.jpg"> </h2>
      <blockquote>
        <p><i>Please note: </i><i><b>the artifacts for release 16.1 are
              being accumulated</b></i><i>. Check back on May 25, 2016
            for the opening of the release artifacts page.</i><br>
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Below are the tranSMART Foundation release artifacts. In the
        case of the war files, please note: the war files are intended
        to be replacements for those in an already installed system. A
        given war file will NOT constitute a complete system on it's
        own; configuration files, data loading, and a raft of supporting
        software is needed. For details, see the instructions on the
        wiki at <a
